# 🚗 Hydrogen Vehicle Simulation Game  
**Course:** CMPT 2021 – Intro to Programming & Simulation  

## 🎮 Project Overview  
This project involved developing a simple game that simulates how hydrogen-powered vehicles operate within a city environment. The goal was to introduce energy-efficient transportation concepts through interactive gameplay.

## 👨‍💻 My Role
- 🛠️ Built the game using **Python**  
- ⛽ Implemented key features like **refueling**, **driving**, and **obstacle avoidance**  
- 🧠 Organized the game logic with clean and modular structure for easy updates and readability  

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python (Pygame for graphics and interaction)  
- Basic Object-Oriented Programming  
- Game Design Principles  

## 🎯 Outcome  
The simulation offers a basic but educational experience, helping users understand how hydrogen vehicles might function in urban transportation systems.
